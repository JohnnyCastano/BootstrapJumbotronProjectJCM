                <h1 class="hi">Photography</h1>
                <p>
                    Photography is one of my favorite things to do when I am on vacation. I like to take pictures that I find aesthetically pleasing, wether it be 
                    a close up picture of a wey pounding drum or just nice picture on a sunny. Pictures are also a good way to express ones feelings and beliefs. You can 
                    take picture of basically anything. It is considered (by me aswell) one of the most beautiful arts in the world!

                <h1 class="hi">Videogames</h1>
                <p>
                    Videogames are probably one of the things that I like to do most. Although many people say it's bad for you, some of it's true, it can still be 
                    good for you in a sense, it can help with fast decision making, getting better instincts, and even better hand-eye coordination. I dont play to 
                    do this though. I can create building and creating, or even destroying, you can do anything with videogames.
